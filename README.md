# hw-latex-template

This is a simple template for typesetting homework solutions in LaTeX.

It is designed for math and computer science assignments, but would work for any discipline (within reason). It can also be adapted (by the TeX-savvy user) to work for other types of documents (e.g., research papers) by adjusting the formatting as necessary.


## Getting Started

You will need a working LaTeX installation on your computer or access to an online service like Overleaf.

- Put `hw_template.tex` into your project directory.
- Address the "TODO" comments in the source.
- Add your content after `\begin{document}`.

See `hw_template.pdf` for an example of what the resulting output will look like.
